# Thesis
This repository has been created to stage the data and code files used in my MS thesis.

Here, the datasets and code used to complete this these are preserved.

The structure of the repository is as follows:
  The folder titled 'data' contains the datasets used in this project, along with a description of those files.
  The folder titled 'Code' contains the scripts used in this project, along with a description of those files.

All coding for this thesis was performed using Python Version 3.7.4

There are two subfolders within the 'Code' folder. These subfolders are organized as follows:
  The subfolder 'ML' contains the scripts used to build the machine learning architecture for the estimate generation, along with a description of those files.
  The subfolder 'Cluster' contains the scripts used to build the cluster analysis model for the error approximation, along with a description of those files.
