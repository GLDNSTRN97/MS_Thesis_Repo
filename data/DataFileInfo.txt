In this folder, the datasets that were used to complete this thesis are stored.

Each data file is approximately 54GB, making the total size of the data used roughly 270GB.

The files with the 'Sec' prefix represent data from different regions of the CONUS 
(i.e: 'SecCP' is for the Central Plains, 'SecNW' is for the Pacific Northwest, etc.)
A more complete description of the region locations (Latitdue, Longitude) is included below:

   Central Plains (SecCP): 35-45.4 North, 103-92.6 West
Pacific Northwest (SecNW): 37.6-48 North, 124-113.6 West
 Desert Southwest (SecSW): 30-40.4 North, 117-106.6 West
       Gulf Coast (SecSE): 25-35.4 North, 91-80.6 West
      New England (SecNE): 36-46.4 North, 83.4-73 West

These files contain GOES-16 Water Vapor, Infrared, and Lightning Mapper data, specifically those of GOES channels 8, 9, 10, 13,and 15, along with GLM flash density
These data have all been resampled to a common grid, that being the 3km HRRR grid.
Each region, as described above, was designed to most closely fit a 10x10 degree lat/lon domain, while using a number of pixels that has an LCM of 2 (384x384 pixels).

The file with the 'Dates' prefix describes the dates and times that each sample in the data files occurs at.
These data files span the entirety of the year 2018, and includes data from January, April, July, and October of 2019.
The data is of hourly temporal resolution, coming from the top of the hour scenes that were available.

These data files have already been screened to remove bad/missing data.
