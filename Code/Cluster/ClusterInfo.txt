This folder contains the code used to develop the error clustering model.

The purpose of this set of code is to classify the error behaviors of the machine learning estimates created by the code in the ML folder by observed regime.

With this cluster analysis, it is hypothesized that the machine learning estimator will have similar errors in these regimes, regardless of physical location.
Therefore, even without the presence of a 'truth' to compare against, one can understand the error of the architecture by understanding the scene environment.
