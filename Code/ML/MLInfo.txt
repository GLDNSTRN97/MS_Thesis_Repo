This folder contains the machine learning code used to generate the MRMS PrecipRate estimates.

There are two types of code used here: the architecture code and the processing code
The architecture code builds and trains the machine learning algorithm. This is the code that is to be tuned to improve the performance of the algorithm.
The processing code generates the estimates created by the trained architecture, alongside various performance metrics.
